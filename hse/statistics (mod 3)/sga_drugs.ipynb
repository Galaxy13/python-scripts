The probability to make Type I error in 1-sided t-test (p-value) is: $0.053 / 2 = 0.0265$. If we assume, that our significance level is 5%, we can say that out result is statistically significant and with significance level of 5%, the drug is effective and it decreases time, needed for cure. But, there is a probablity (around 3%) that the drug is ineffective and investment in it cause a Type I error, since data size of such clinical trial is very small and with only 6% of significance level we can say, that there is any effect."
